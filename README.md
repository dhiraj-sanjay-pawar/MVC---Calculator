# Day 3 - Flutter Learning

## Introduction
In this markdown file, we'll walk through the development of a simple calculator application using Flutter, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. We'll start from the basics, explaining project structure, and gradually delve into the logic behind each component of the application.

## Project Structure
The project structure is organized following the MVC architecture, which separates concerns into Models, Views, and Controllers:

```
lib/
  |- models/
  |   |- calculation.dart
  |- views/
  |   |- calculator_page.dart
  |- controllers/
  |   |- calculator_controller.dart
main.dart
```

- **models/**: Contains data models, such as Calculation, which represents the data and business logic.
- **views/**: Contains UI components, like CalculatorPage, which represent the visual elements of the application.
- **controllers/**: Contains controllers, such as CalculatorController, responsible for handling user input and updating the Model and View accordingly.
- **main.dart**: Entry point of the Flutter application.

## Model - Calculation
The Calculation model represents the data and logic for performing arithmetic operations. It has properties for two numbers and the result, along with a method to perform addition.

```dart
class Calculation {
  int? number1;
  int? number2;
  int? result;

  Calculation({this.number1, this.number2, this.result});

  void performAddition() {
    if (number1 != null && number2 != null) {
      result = number1! + number2!;
    }
  }
}
```

## View - CalculatorPage
The CalculatorPage widget represents the UI for the calculator application. It allows users to input two numbers and trigger addition. It also displays the result of the calculation.

```dart
class CalculatorPage extends StatelessWidget {
  final TextEditingController _number1Controller = TextEditingController();
  final TextEditingController _number2Controller = TextEditingController();
  final CalculatorController _controller = CalculatorController();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Widget implementation...
  }
}
```

## Controller - CalculatorController
The CalculatorController is responsible for handling user input, performing addition, and updating the View with the result. It manages the stream of calculations and exposes methods to perform addition and dispose of resources.

```dart
class CalculatorController {
  final _calculationController = StreamController<Calculation>.broadcast();

  Stream<Calculation> get calculationStream => _calculationController.stream;

  void performAddition(int? number1, int? number2) {
    Calculation calculation = Calculation(number1: number1, number2: number2);
    calculation.performAddition();
    _calculationController.add(calculation);
  }

  void dispose() {
    _calculationController.close();
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
By following the MVC architecture, we've successfully developed a simple calculator application in Flutter. The separation of concerns into Models, Views, and Controllers makes the codebase easier to manage, understand, and maintain. This project serves as a foundational learning experience for Flutter application development.
